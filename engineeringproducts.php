    <h3>Types of Bearings</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="type_bearing"> <b>1. Ball Bearings</b>
      <p>Ball Bearings are probably one of the most common types of bearings that are useful for different purposes. These types of bearings are found in applications where there is lesser load, hence this type of bearing can handle radial and thrust load having the wide range of operating speeds.</p>
      <p>Ball bearings are pretty much versatile in nature. Different applications where ball bearings are used are gear reducers, electric motors, and pumps. Apart from this, ball bearings also serve different purposes for heavy industrial equipment like pumps, extruders, large motors, mining, oil and gas drilling and mining applications</p>
      <div class=""> <b>Types of Ball Bearings are:</b>

    </div>
    <div class="type_bearing"> <b>2. Cylindrical Roller Bearings</b>
      <p>Cylindrical Roller Bearings are made to hold heavy radial loads, they are usually used in applications like conveyor belt rollers, etc. In this case, the bearing has a roller that is cylinder hence the point of contact is a line. This helps to spread the load over the larger area that allows the bearing to handle greater loads in comparison to a ball bearing. Cylindrical bearings are made with the single row, two rows or multi-rows of rolling elements that help to meet an application’s radial load requirement.</p>
      <p>Roller bearings are available in many standard series and configurations that are used in the wide number of industries. The unique characteristic of having a high load capacity, industrial interchange ability and moderate speed rating makes its design, the most popular bearing designs available.</p>

    <div class="type_bearing"> <b>3. Tapered Roller Bearings</b>
      <p>Tapered Roller Bearings are common in industrial applications, the tapered rollers in the bearings allow it to accommodate heavy radial, axial and combination loads. The bearing configuration and its flexible loading capability are designed from single cups, double cups, and cones. Hence, they are used in almost every industry use.</p>
      <p>The standard tapered roller bearings have a “pin-type” design that makes it versatile to be used in the variety of applications. It is most commonly used in applications having very high loads and high speeds.</p>

    <div class="type_bearing"> <b>4.  Spherical Roller Bearings</b>
      <p>Spherical Roller Bearings are rolling element bearings that help rotation with low friction and it also allows angular misalignment too. The misalignment is permitted due to the spherical internal shape of the outer ring and spherical rollers. Spherical roller bearings support rotating shaft into the bore of an inner ring that could be misaligned as compared to the outer ring.</p>
      <p>As their name represents, they are NOT truly spherical in shape, the rolling elements in roller bearings are more cylindrical in shape, slightly over-inflated. Spherical roller bearings are used in varieties of industrial applications that have heavy loads and moderate speeds. Most common applications are wind turbines, gearboxes, pumps, mechanical fans, construction equipment, marine propulsions, off-roading vehicles, etc.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="type_bearing"> <b>5. Thrust Bearings</b>
      <p>Thrust bearings are a type of rotary bearings, they allow rotation between the parts and are so designed to support high axial load while being parallel to the shaft. Different thrust bearings are used for supporting different amounts of axial loads.</p>
      <p>The ball thrust series can relatively handle lighter loads while the Angular contact series can handle the load from both radial and thrust loads in both directions. There are several designs and configurations available in thrust bearings depending on the industry type and applications for they are used.</p>

  <div class="grear-content">
    <p>Curved Tooth Flexible Gear Couplings are unique of its kind in the field of mechanical power transmission. These gear couplings have outstanding features like mechanical flexibility and compensation of misalignment (angular, parallel and axial) of the connected shafts. These can used extensively in various industries like rolling mills, cranes, cement plants, dredgers, conveyors and elevators, rubber & plastic industries, compressors, fans, blowers, and in many other industries. These couplings consist of to halves with internal teeth having curved/ crowned shape & two outer sleeves with internal spur teeth. Thus coupling ensures a greater flexibility because of its well  designed tooth profile which allows a maximum area of contact between the external and internal teeth under any misaligned condition. Special ‘O’ rings have been provided at the end of the coupling hubs to prevent any leakage of the lubricant and entry of dust inside the coupling. </p>
    <p>Up to size FGC - 03 both hubs and casings are made of steel confirming to 45C - 8 of IS : 1570. From size FGC - 04 casings are made of cast steel confirming to 23 - 45 of IS : 1030.
