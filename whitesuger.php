 <p>Sugar is the general name for sweet-tasting soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in foods. Table sugar, granulated sugar or ordinary sugar refers to sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose. Monosaccharides, also known as monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose</p>
 <p>You may have heard the term "sucrose" at one point or another, but is that true? Although sucrose sounds too technical or even artificial, it is just the chemical name of sugar. Sugar is a simple carbohydrate that we know and love. It is naturally produced in all plants (including fruits, vegetables and even nuts)</p>
